# Process Management Application for CICS
This is a simple application for CICS. It is serving two purposes for me individually: 
One, it provides a clean simple way for us to save and store information that is easy to modify and add new features.
Two, it was a good way to teach myself CICS. I have been a mainframe developer for quite some time and have always
wanted to branch into the CICS world. This seemed like a good way to do so and it also not be a useless exorcise.

The reason I am sharing this program is due to the lack of good documentation and examples for CICS programs.
I have found most of the "old timers" in the mainframe world are reluctant to answer questions without a load
of questions that are irrelevant. This application should work as is in your development environment, all you
need to do is create the VSAM files and add them to your development region. 

I am including in this repository the following files/types:
COPYLIB - Copybooks
INFO - CICS Information
JCL - Job Control Language
MAPSET - BMS Mapsets
SOURCE - CICS COBOL Source
